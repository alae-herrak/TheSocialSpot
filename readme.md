# theSocialSpot

## Instructions for running the project

- **theSocialSpot** uses MySQL as a database so make sure you create the database using the `thesocialspot.sql` provided file

- In the _server_ and _client_ folders you need to rename the `.env.example` files to `.env`
- **IMPORTANT FOR GOOGLE LOGIN :** if you want to be able to use google login you need to setup and get your CLIENTID from *https://console.cloud.google.com*, once that's done go ahead and paste your CLIENTID into the client folder `.env` file
- Open the _client_ folder in a terminal and the _server_ folder in another terminal, then run the command `npm install` for both
- To start the project run the following commandes:
  - For _client_ : `npm run dev`
  - For _server_ : `npm start`
